# Kaylie-Semester1-Portfolio
A collection of all the Python projects I've completed during Semester 1 of AP Computer Science Principles. 

**Project 1: Multiplication Quiz**

This "Multiplication Quiz" project is meant to test the multiplication skills of those who want to test themselves. The project allows the user to choose the mode of difficulty, and as the difficulty increases, the numbers are greater. Additionally, it allows users to time how fast it takes to solve a certain number of questions fo their choosing.  This project repeats until the user no longer wants to play. 

Key Features:
1. Difficulty settings, "Easy," (factors from 0 to 10) "Normal," (factors from -12 to 12) and "Hard" (factors from -50 to 50). All factors are randomized numbers within the listed ranges. 
2. Users can choose how many multiplication problems they'd like to answer.
3. A timer, timing how long the user took to answer the specified number of questions.
4. Endless mode gameplay -- the game doesn't stop until the user explicitely answers "No" to playing again.
5. Total score: The program calculates the user's total score (how many problems they got right and wrong)

**Project 2: Number Guesser**

"Number Guesser" does exactly what the title suggests. The user chooses a mode, which can be either easy, medium, or hard. A harder mode means that the user must guess the correct number from a wider range of integers. The user has 3 lives, 3 chances, to guess a number. To each wrong response, the program will hint at whether the user must guess a smaller or bigger number until the game ends. Then, the user will have the chance to either play again or quit. 

Key Features:
1. Difficulty settings: Easy (number range of 0-5), Medium (number range of 0-10), or Hard (number range of 0-15)
2. Limited lives: The user has 3 lives, 3 chances, to guess the correct number. Each incorrect guess will result in a live lost. Once lives reach 0, the game ends. 
3. Hint system: After each wrong guess, the program tells the player to guess either a larger or smaller number.
4. Endless mode gameplay -- the game doesn't stop until the user explicitely answers "No" to playing again.
5. Randomized number system: The number the player must guess changes each round. 

**Project 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors**

The player can play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Each round, the computer randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors, and plays against the player. Scores for each round are tallied up and the game can be played infinitely. 

Key Features: 
1. Randomized rock, paper, scissors gameplay
2. Graphics visually demonstrating either rock, paper, or scissors
3. Endless mode gameplay -- the game doesn't stop until the user explicitely answers "No" to playing again.
4. Score recording -- scores are recorded and tallied between player and computer each round

**Project 4: Simple Calculator**

"Simple Calculator" is a program that performs basic, 4-function calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.) It allows users to input 2 values, and the program returns the solution to the operation. 

Key Features: 
1. 4-function calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)
2. User input of up to two factors/addends/etc.
3. "Quit program" option, or the calculator can go on endlessly

**Project 5: Ticket Generator**

"Ticket Generator" is a project which asks users for input on who they are, when they want to visit a museum the ticket is for, and if they have any coupon codes. After recieving responses, a ticket is generated in Python Turtle. 

Key Features: 
1. Ticket generation visual, ticket is generated in Python Turtle depending on user response.
2. Coupon codes: Price is lowered depending on whether the correct code is submitted and on the day of the week
3. Age-depending pricing: price is also lower depending on whether the ticket is for an adult, teen, child, or elder

This concludes my Semester 1 AP Computer Science portfolio!
