# Kaylie-Semester1-Portfolio
A collection of all the Python projects I've completed during Semester 1 of AP Computer Science Principles. 

**Project 1: Multiplication Quiz**

This "Multiplication Quiz" project is meant to test the multiplication skills of those who want to test themselves. The project allows the user to choose the mode of difficulty, and as the difficulty increases, the numbers are greater. Additionally, it allows users to time how fast it takes to solve a certain number of questions fo their choosing.  This project repeats until the user no longer wants to play. 

Key Features:
1. Difficulty settings, "Easy," (factors from 0 to 10) "Normal," (factors from -12 to 12) and "Hard" (factors from -50 to 50). All factors are randomized numbers within the listed ranges. 
2. Users can choose how many multiplication problems they'd like to answer.
3. A timer, timing how long the user took to answer the specified number of questions.
4. Endless mode gameplay -- the game doesn't stop until the user explicitely answers "No" to playing again.
5. Total score: The program calculates the user's total score (how many problems they got right and wrong)

**Project 2: Number Guesser**

"Number Guesser" does exactly what the title suggests. The user chooses a mode, which can be either easy, medium, or hard. A harder mode means that the user must guess the correct number from a wider range of integers. The user has 3 lives, 3 chances, to guess a number. To each wrong response, the program will hint at whether the user must guess a smaller or bigger number until the game ends. Then, the user will have the chance to either play again or quit. 

Key Features:
1. Difficulty settings: Easy (number range of 0-5), Medium (number range of 0-10), or Hard (number range of 0-15)
2. Limited lives: The user has 3 lives, 3 chances, to guess the correct number. Each incorrect guess will result in a live lost. Once lives reach 0, the game ends. 
3. Hint system: After each wrong guess, the program tells the player to guess either a larger or smaller number.
4. Endless mode gameplay -- the game doesn't stop until the user explicitely answers "No" to playing again.
5. Randomized number system: The number the player must guess changes each round.
